-Autocorrelation graph in pb2 seems to have +ve value in a wider range of lags, meaning that the heartrate is faster.

-also we can prove that if we measure heart rate from the peak after lag 0
heart rate = 60/(lag/512) = 60/(236/512) = 130 bpm

-faster heart rate could happen if there's sinus tachycardia or Atrial Fibrillation, from observation of Raw ECG the P wave has a different shape which is a property of Atrial Arrhythmias

so Data2 is for a person who has Atrial Fibrillation.

- a measure that can be computed from the autocorrelation that increases as the amount of Atrial Fibrillation increases is avg heart rate,
we can use a threshold at 0.6*10^7 and get the peaks over that threshold, then calculate heart rate from lags corresponding to peaks.
if avg heart rate > 100 then it's Atrial Fibrillation. 

if we apply this on pb1(printed output is):
avg heart rate = 68.04370324268633 bpm

and on pb2:
avg heart rate = 130.39682780797057 bpm
Atrial Fibrillation detected!
